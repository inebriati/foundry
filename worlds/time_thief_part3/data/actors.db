They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages.

They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"781\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Status and Slaves.</span></span> <p>Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist.

They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"782\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Obsessive Collectors.</span></span> <p>Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"783\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Red Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"784\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons.</span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"786\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"787\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs.</span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"788\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons.</span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"901\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons.</span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"903\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"904\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs.</span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure.

A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano.

She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.

She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.&nbsp; Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.&nbsp; The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.&nbsp; With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.&nbsp; The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.&nbsp; Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.&nbsp; One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.&nbsp; Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.&nbsp; Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.&nbsp;

Vaprak likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4423\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Vaprak's Blessing.</span></span> <p> After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.</p><div

Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p><p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p><p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks.

It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p><p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"768\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Manipulative Schemers.</span></span> <p>A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires.

They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will.

However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p><p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"772\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons.</span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"774\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"775\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs.</span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"776\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons.</span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"720\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures.

They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing.

However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all.

The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise.
